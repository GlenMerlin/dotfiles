# .Files
This repo contains scripts to fix and customize my system to (mostly) automate building my system from scratch.

I use zsh with EndeavourOS Gnome

Run any scripts at your own risk.

# Scripts
The scripts that can be found here are
- fix-emoji.sh 
- fix-paru.sh
- fix-zsh-prompt.sh
- install.sh

## fix-emoji.sh
ensures that the proper emoji fonts are installed and creates a file to force some apps to respect the emoji (like discord)

## fix-paru.sh
changes options in paru to make sense (why is bottom up not the default??)

## fix-zsh-prompt.sh
Installs my custom zsh prompt

## install.sh
runs all of the scripts and builds the system with all of my packages
